INSTRUCTIONS (for ChromeOS/Chromebooks):

Once shared with the user through Google Drive, Go to file explorer.
This is a blue folder icon. If not already pinned to your taskbar, search for "files" using the search key on your keyboard.
Once opened, go to your Google Drive (still in the file explorer). This is at the bottom left.
Go to "Shared with me" and double click "doxicon-src v4.0"
Double click on "index.html". This should open up doxicon in your browser. 
Use ctrl-d to bookmark the tab. 
Now you have doxicon and can do stuff.
